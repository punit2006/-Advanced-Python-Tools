#ADVANCED PYTHON TOOLS
#ASSIGNMENT - 1

Objective Understand the basics of NumPy, array creation, and manipulation.

Step 1 Install NumPy using
pip install numpy


Step 2 Create a new Python script numpy_assignment.ipynb. Import NumPy and follow these steps:  


1. Create a 1D NumPy array with integers from 1 to 20. Perform the following operations:  
  a. Calculate the sum, mean, median, and standard deviation of the elements in the array.  
  b. Find the indices of elements greater than 10 in the array.  


2. Create a 2D NumPy array of shape 4 X 4 with numbers ranging from 1 to 16.  
  a. Print the array.  
  b. Find the transpose of the array.  
  c. Calculate the row-wise and column-wise sums of the array.  


3. Create two 3 X 3 arrays filled with random integers between 1 and 20.  
  a. Perform element-wise addition, subtraction, and multiplication.  
  b. Compute the dot product of the two arrays.  


4. Reshape a 1D array of size 12 into a 3 X 4 2D array and slice the first two rows and last two columns.
